    #EVENTS#
    twrromaniahungary.1.t:0 "Transylvania Opportunity"
    twrromaniahungary.1.d:0 "For years, Germany has forced Hungary and Romania to cooperate under its greater sphere. Now that Germany is out of the picture, we have a golden opportunity to retake northern Transylvania from the Hungarians. The cabinet is pressing for war, a war to finally unify Romania under our banner. Striking the Hungarians by surprise might be the best chance for a swift victory for our superior military and industrial might."
    twrromaniahungary.1.a:0 "Get ready for an invasion!"
    twrromaniahungary.1.b:0 "Postpone it..."
    twrromaniahungary.2.t:0 "Operation Romania"
    twrromaniahungary.2.d:0 "The time is now.\n\nOur period of preparation has ended and it is finally the time to execute Operation Romania, to unify Greater Romania once and for all, and to finally end the humiliation forced upon us from the Second Vienna Award.\n\nOur troops are now marching into Hungary, marching to liberate Transylvania."
    twrromaniahungary.2.a:0 "To war! For Greater Romania!"
    twrromaniahungary.3.t:0 "Romanian Attack"
    twrromaniahungary.3.d:0 "Romanian forces have entered Hungarian soil under a coordinated attack. The Hungarian Government is now organizing a defence against the enemy while the national reserves and militias have been called into service in an attempt to defend our Fatherland."
    twrromaniahungary.3.a:0 "Defend Hungary!"
    twrromaniahungary.4.t:0 "Romanian-Hungarian War"
    twrromaniahungary.4.d:0 "The relationship between Romania and Hungary have always been turbulent. Without the supervision of Germany, these two have now engaged in full blown war for the ownership of Transylvania.\n\nThe Hungarian Government has declared this act as "barbaric", due to the lack of a formal declaration from Romania's part. Meanwhile in Bucharest, crowds of supporters have gathered in the city square, supporting the government's efforts in retaking Transylvania in the name of Greater Romania."
    twrromaniahungary.4.a:0 "Unsurprising."
    twrromaniahungary.5.t:0 "Call for Peace"
    twrromaniahungary.5.d:0 "Our forces have been unable to accomplish their goals, and after great losses, the enthusiasm for this war has faded. Both sides are now tired of the seemingly endless stalemate, and have now agreed to end this conflict with status quo.\n\nWhile Romania technically didn't lose anything, the fact that the Government failed to fulfill its goals might shake the regime and greatly impact political stability."
    twrromaniahungary.5.a:0 "Oh well..."
    twrromaniahungary.7.t:0 "Romanian Victory"
    twrromaniahungary.7.d:0 "With the successful occupation of Transylvania, we have managed to strike a peace settlement to finally unify Greater Romania. We have at last rid Romania of national humiliation! This victory has greatly improved our government's legitimacy and national stability."
    twrromaniahungary.7.a:0 "Greater Romania!"
    twrromaniahungary.8.t:0 "Hungarian Victory"
    twrromaniahungary.8.d:0 "Despite the numerical advantage that the Romanian army holds, Hungary has managed to accomplish the impossible of defeating Romania in open battle.\n\nCitizens are celebrating throughout Budapest, and we have managed to enforce war reparations onto Romania, to compensate for damages done by their unprovoked attack."
    twrromaniahungary.8.a:0 "Regnum Mariae Patrona Hungariae!"
    twrromaniahungary.9.t:0 "Unification of Greater Romania"
    twrromaniahungary.9.d:0 "Transylvania has been transferred back into Romania after their victory in the recent Romanian-Hungarian War. While this undoubtedly empowered the Romanian regime, Hungary might be pushed into total collapse after this humiliating defeat.\n\nExperts are sure that the events of that region have yet to truly unfold, and the future of the Hungarian dictatorship is rather grim, though it is totally uncertain what future developments political collapse could bring for the Kingdom of Hungary."
    twrromaniahungary.9.a:0 "Nihil Sine Deo!"
    twrromaniahungary.9.b:0 "How unstable..."
	
	twrromania.2.t:0 "King Michael's Coup?"
	twrromania.2.d:0 "With the beginning of the German Civil War, the King has thought about attempting to remove Ion Antonescu and appointing a new cabinet to replace the Pro-German Antonescu."
	twrromania.2.a:0 "This is a bad idea."
	twrromania.2.b:0 "Prepare to depose Antonescu!"
	
	twrromania.3.t:0 "King Michael's Coup"
	twrromania.3.d:0 "At exactly 12:00 EET, forces loyal to His Majesty Michael I moved to arrest Ion Antonescu, and after a short shootout with his bodyguards, captured and promptly executed him for 'treason'. Shortly afterwards, His Majesty delivered a short speech declaring that the Marshal has failed the Romanian people by allowing the Hungarian occupation of Northern Transylvania to continue, and furthermore was an oppressive tyrant trampling over the people of Romania. The King has decided to appoint a temporary government, though elections, if there are any, will not be held until after the impending war."
	twrromania.3.a:0 "Install a PNT Government!"
	twrromania.3.b:0 "Install a PNL Government!"

    twrromania.301.t:0 "Coup in Romania"
    twrromania.301.d:0 "Alarming to some, while welcomed by others, news coming out of Romania indicates a sudden change in the governance of the country has occurred. The country had long been headed by Conducator Ion Antonescu.\n\nLong considered to be a figurehead, the King's recent actions speak otherwise. While no one can accurately predict the direction in which Romania will head now, many concur that the King in all cases would need to appoint an entirely new Cabinet to stabilize the country, and prevent a possible counter-coup."
    twrromania.301.a:0 "It is time for Romania to change!"
    twrromania.301.b:0 "A change in leadership."
	
	twrromania.4.t:0 "Romanian Elections"
	twrromania.4.d:0 "With the conclusion of the war with Hungary, Michael I has called for an election to fully restore democracy to the Kingdom of Romania."
	twrromania.4.a:0 "PNT Victory!"
	twrromania.4.b:0 "PNL Victory!"
	twrromania.4.c:0 "A suprise victory from the PSD!"
    twrromania.4.e:0 "The Iron Guard coups the government!"

    HUN_reparations:0 "War Reparations"
    HUN_reparations_desc:0 "Romania started the war. Now that they lost it, it's logical for us to demand reparations from the aggressors."
    ROM_victory:0 "Romanian Victory"
    ROM_victory_desc:0 "Romania has finally unified. This victory is a great tool for the government to boost it's own power and political stability."
    ROMHUN_defeat:0 "Defeated and Broken"
    ROMHUN_defeat_desc:0 "We have suffered a humiliating defeat on the fields of Hungary, our stability and political order are now on the brink of total destruction..."
    ROM_failed_invasion:0 "The Failed Invasion"
    ROM_failed_invasion_desc:0 "While technically a draw, the fact that the government failed to win a war that they themselves declared is considered to be a national humiliation by many, which is greatly impacting the rule of Romania's current government
