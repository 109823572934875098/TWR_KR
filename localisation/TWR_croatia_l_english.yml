twrgermancroatia.2.t:0 "Germany Collapses!"
twrgermancroatia.2.d:0 "What many outside analysts and diplomatic officials predicted has finally happened, the core of the great German empire has fallen into conflict and civil war. Various factions of the National Socialist German Workers Party are vying for control of the country's future, and many national liberation movements have risen up in an attempt to achieve independence from the German Reich. In Zagreb, the new German civil war has also caused a great deal of panic and reaction. Since the campaign into the old Yugoslavia, the Germans have been our greatest patrons in the effort to build a free and national Croatia. By the end of the 40s, they were effectively our sole trading partner, and Croatia found itself to be a well-fitting puzzle piece in the new German order on the European continent. \n\nBut all of that is gone now. The German diplomatic delegation in Zagreb tore itself apart, as the foreign service was just as divided as the country itself. Different members of the German sphere have pledged allegiance to one faction or the other, but those decisions were mostly arbitrary. Croatia now stands alone. Will it find solace in isolation, or will it try to pick some meat off the carcass of Europe?"
twrgermancroatia.2.a:0 "Only time will tell..."
twrgermancroatia.3.t:0 "Out With the Old..."
twrgermancroatia.3.d:0 "In the Usatshe two men distingushed themselves as the potential successors, one was called Andrija the other was called Vjekoslav. Both wanted the same thing - control of the Croat nation now that its former master had been deposed of.\n\nBoth of these men claimed to be loyal to the Croatian nation, but both have wildly different views on policies and nationhood. While one represented the old status quo of stability and order, the other represented a younger generation of radicals, seeking to imitate the Germans and their system."
twrgermancroatia.3.a:0 "In comes the new of our German brothers!."
twrgermancroatia.3.b:0 "In comes the old, for who speaks better than us?"
twrcroatia.1.t:0 "The Agreement of Zara"
twrcroatia.1.d:0 "While relations with Italy have been rough in the past, they have started to improve since we reestablished diplomatic ties with them. Now its our chances to get back our righful lands without having to shed any blood. \n\nThe Treaty of Zara was crafted in order to appeal to Italy as much as possible so we can get an actual chance of them signing it. In exchange for the return of Zara and Istria, we would join the Mediterranean Pact along with demilitarising the regions. Lastly, we would pay them back for all the infastructure they build in the regions, which we believe we can accomplish in half a year. \n\nNow our diplomats are the only ones who can achieve the signing of this agreement."
twrcroatia.1.a:0 "Lets hope for the best"
twrcroatia.2.t:0 "The Agreement Succeeded!"
twrcroatia.2.d:0 "After much discussion with the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Italians agreed to our proposal and signed it, welcoming us to the Mediterranean Pact. In Zara and Istria, celebrations were organised by the croat citizens, welcoming our politicians and public figures."
twrcroatia.2.a:0 "The Croat State is victorious once more!"
twrcroatia.2010.t:0 "Zara Agreement"
twrcroatia.2010.d:0 "Under the policy of \"Mare Nostrum\", Italy has annexed parts of Dalmatia in the name of Italian irredentism. However, these policies have been drastically shifted after an agreement between Italy and Croatia.\n\nUnder the Zara Agreement, the previously appointed Italian king has been given more authority, a historic return of actual status since its decline in the late 1940s. In exchange for greater Italian control over Croatia, the Italian settlements in Dalmatia were handed back to the Croatian government."
twrcroatia.2010.a:0 "Interesting development for the Adriatic."
twrcroatia.6010.t:0 "Istria Agreement"
twrcroatia.6010.d:0 "Following the Zara Agreement, the Istria Agreement is an even more ambitious project created by Croatia. Under the Istria Agreement, the Croatian borders will expand more, but with the price of allowing greater Italian influence to meddle with Croatian politics, effectively breaking the condominium status of the Independent State of Croatia."
twrcroatia.6010.a:0 "A Greater Croatia."
twrcroatia.1010.t:0 "Croatian-Hungarian War"
twrcroatia.1010.d:0 "Attempting to achieve the dream of a greater Croatia, the Croatian military has launched an invasion into Hungarian soils, attempting to secure their \"rightful Croatian territories\".\n\nWhile it is difficult to tell which side might win at this rate, this war is yet another mark of Hungary's hated position in the Balkans."
twrcroatia.1010.a:0 "A grudge to settle between the two..."
twrcroatia.1110.t:0 "Croatian Victory"
twrcroatia.1110.d:0 "Through effective military actions, the Croatians have defeated the Hungarians and occupied Vojvodina.\n\nThese military actions have forced the Hungarian government to give up their influence in the region of Vojvodina, allowing the Croatians to occupy it. This development is one closer step for the Croatians to achieve a Greater Croatia."
twrcroatia.1110.a:0 "For Greater Croatia!"
twrcroatia.1110.b:0 "Somehow, they did it!"
twrcroatia.1210.t:0 "Croatian Defeated"
twrcroatia.1210.d:0 "With decisive responses from the Hungarian military, the Croatians have been soundly defeated on the battlefield.\n\nThe Hungarians have demanded reparations, but the status quo in that region have largely been preserved. However, the political damage that this defeat has on Croatia is far greater than expected, as the government now has to handle a disgruntled population with a fractured leadership."
twrcroatia.1210.a:0 "The Croatian dream crumbles."
twrcroatia.3010.t:0 "Pavelic Resigns"
twrcroatia.3010.d:0 "Long time dictator and Poglavnik of Croatia, Ante Pavelic has resigned from his position in great shame.\n\nThis resignation is the result of a grand political crisis in the Ustasha, in which the Pavelic administration was blamed for Croatia's shortcomings, causing a great divide between the party factions.\n\nFor now, the interim council will lead Croatia, until the next Poglavnik assumes control."
twrcroatia.3010.a:0 "Croatia is in crisis!"
twrcroatia.3011.t:0 "Luburic's Croatia"
twrcroatia.3011.d:0 "Disturbing news from Zagreb: General Vjekoslav Luburic has assumed control of the Independent State of Croatia, the general is well-known as a fervent Croatian nationalist with many Pro-German elements. He is notorious amongst the Slavic population for his atrocities against them ever since the creation of the NDH. The general took control after Ante Pavelić suddenly retired, many people in Croatia have raised doubts on the legitimacy of the power change, doubts that are quickly shutted down. Pavelic himself didn't respond to these questions and the only thing he said was that Luburic was a worthy successor to his rule.\n\nMany people in the Balkan hold their hearts as they fear that with this new radical leader in charge yet another war in the Balkan is on the horizon."
twrcroatia.3011.a:0 "National Socialism arrives in Croatia."
twrcroatia.3013.t:0 "Artukovic's Croatia"
twrcroatia.3013.d:0 "The former minister of internal affairs and justice Andrija Artukovic has been proclaimed as the new poglavnik of the NDH. The minister is well known as a loyal follower of the Ustasha and Pavelic. It is expected that he will continue the path Croatia is currently on as a fascist dictatorship with strict racial laws. Pavelić himself didn't respond to these questions and said that Artukovic was a succesor worthy to his rule.\n\nIt is expected that this new leader will mantain the current status quo Croatia is currently in with appeasing both the Germans and the Italians. The transition of power went peacefully, and barely anyone has challenged this result."
twrcroatia.3013.a:0 "More of the same."
twrcroatia.3.t:0 "The Agreement Failed!"
twrcroatia.3.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the Italians sent our diplomats back home with a ripped piece of paper. War with the Italians is not something Croatia can afford or hope to win, so we will have to look in shame to our Western lands."
twrcroatia.3.a:0 "The spaghetti gobblers have kicked us to the curb again..."
twrcroatia.4.t:0 "The Agreement Succeeded!"
twrcroatia.4.d:0 "After much discussion with our allies, the Italians agreed to our proposal, ceding Istria to us. In Istria, celebrations werent as big as we expected, with many italian settlers unhappy about them becoming our subjects. Oh well, you can't make everyone happy."
twrcroatia.4.a:0 "Glory to Greater Croatia!"
twrcroatia.5.t:0 "The Agreement Failed!"
twrcroatia.5.d:0 "No matter what we offered, the Italians rejected all our offers leaving us empty handed once more. Well, we can't do much now and as our allies, we have to try and work with them."
twrcroatia.5.a:0 "You win some...you lose even more"
twrcroatia.6.t:0 "The Agreement of Istria"
twrcroatia.6.d:0 "Since our entrance into the Mediterranean Pact, our relations with Italy have been improving, with the return of Zara being a milestone in Italian-Croat relations. Now, we have another agreement to offer the Italians as to regain our Western lands in our quest for Greater Croatia! We will request Istria in exchange for heavy monetary payments and extra military rights for Italy. While we don't have much else to offer, hopefully the Italians will accept our offer and we can continue our quest for Greater Croatia!"
twrcroatia.6.a:0 "Maybe the pen is mightier than the sword"
twrcroatia.7.t:0 "Prepare the Battlefield"
twrcroatia.7.d:0 "For us to even attempt to take back Vojvodina from the Hungarians, we will have to set up the battlefield to be in our favour as much as possible. The region has quite the population of Croats in it and we can put them to use. If we send over some of our agents to stir up discontent and start a rebellion against the Hungarians, we can destroy our enemies infastructure and delay them as much as possible."
twrcroatia.7.a:0 "Now we need to prepare our own troops!"
twrcroatia.8.t:0 "The Battle of Vojvodina"
twrcroatia.8.d:0 "Having planned and prepared for this exact moment, our soldiers have been sent off to the Hungarian border in order to fight for our claims in Vojvodina! Filled with patriotic pride, our soldiers march on to fight until the last man for the dream of Greater Croatia!"
twrcroatia.8.a:0 "For Greater Croatia!"
twrcroatia.9.t:0 "Vojvodina is ours!"
twrcroatia.9.d:0 "After a harsh battle, our soldiers raised heroically our banner over Vojvodina, dropping the teared apart banner of Hungary in the mud. Our dreams for Greater Croatia come closer with each of our steps!"
twrcroatia.9.a:0 "Slava Hrvatskoj!"
twrcroatia.10.t:0 "Defeat in Vojvodina"
twrcroatia.10.d:0 "No matter our best efforts, the Hungarians managed to defend their ground, forcing our soldiers into a frenzied retreat like a bunch of cowards. We can't show the world our weakness like this! We will put those cowards back in the battlefield wether they like or not! \n\nBut is total war with Hungary worth it and do we even have a chance to win?"
twrcroatia.10.a:0 "Death to the Hungarian Rats!"
twrcroatia.10.b:0 "Total war is not something we can achieve..."
twrcroatia.11.t:0 "Treaty of Pecs"
twrcroatia.11.d:0 "After fighting with all their might, we have come victorious against the Hungarians! Ceding to us Vojvodina and Prekmurje by signing the treaty, we were more than satisfied as our dream of Greater Croatia expanded further than our original plans. As we left, we humiliated the Hungarians once more by throwing degrading insults at them." 
twrcroatia.11.a:0 "Slava Hrvatskoj!"
twrcroatia.12.t:0 "Treaty of Zagreb"
twrcroatia.12.d:0 "This is a dark day for Croatia. The war against Hungary has been lost and with it, the dream of Greater Croatia have been shuttered. Forced to sign a humiliating treaty, we have lost Novi Sad to Hungary along with our pride. Let the men who fell for their country rest...in shame!"
twrcroatia.12.a:0 "To hell with the Magyars!"

We shall see to it that the Hungarians get what they deserve for snatching our rightful lands from the King of the South Slavs."

This, combined with ourselves declaring us the King and protector of all South Slavs, shall start to persuade the scared masses to our cause. For offering our help shall be enough for them to resist against the Hungarian tyrants, and to demand to be brought back into the Fatherland. Soon… there will be a single united Croat state."
