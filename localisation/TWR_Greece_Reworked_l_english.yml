twrGreeceRework.25.d:0 "Greece has seen better days. While officially, the occupation is over, the Italian jackboot is felt everywhere: In the commands of "advisors" slavishly followed by collaborationist politicians, and in the strangled economy, held down by subordination to Rome.\n\nThe recent fall of the Logothetopoulos cabinet, consequence of its inability to stabilize the political situation, convinced Greece's overlords that a new, more conciliatory approach was needed. The result was to name Ioannis Rallis as the new prime minister. While Rallis is unmistakably a collaborator, and by extension, universally hated, he and his "Unionist" clique in the ruling oligarchy have expressed their intention to undertake reforms of a magnitude sufficient so as to reconcile the common people with the government.\n\nRallis's rhetoric has raised cautious hope that he might steer Greece back into something resembling normalcy. These optimistic expectations are to be found primarily expressed by the Italian officials who have grown increasingly tired of having to put down partisan uprisings on a regular basis. Ironically, the inflexibility of these same men could very well be the cause of Rallis's downfall, should they not permit the collaborationist government enough freedom to carry out its promised reforms.\n\nAmongst those who saw the appointment of Rallis as a primarily negative development, the growing resistance movement is the most important. Having long banked on the incompetence of successive italian-appointed cabinets to gain strength, a successful premiership could well spell the end of their ambitions to liberate Greece. If, on the contrary, Rallis were to fail and the colaborationist's credibility fully exhausted, only Italy's determination to hold on to the Peloponnese could stop the partisans from taking power."

From the raised platform before the parliament building Rallis speaks passionately about the Greek way of life and, whilst still stressing support for their "allies and benefactors" in the Axis, speaks of a return to the time before the war. \n\nAs he continues to extoll the "Hellenic virtues" of their resilient nation a light murmur of approval is heard from the crowd and Rallis seizes the initiative to capture their hearts. Passion tints his words as he raises his hands to thank the people for their courage in these trying times and to assure them that it is only by their indomitable spirit that Greece marches on. And furthermore- \n\nThere is a shout behind him. He turns to the sound of a clamber on the platform. Rallis' eyes barely register the man's Evzone guard uniform before he feels the cold steel of a bayonet in his gut. Pain blooms and his old legs buckle. The President desperately tries to cling to the podium, still half turned towards the audience. \n\nMore pain. Another stab. Gunshots. A shout. The last thing President Ioannis Rallis sees is a panicked crowd dispersing as the assassin lies dead next to him. When did he fall on the floor? He wonders that as his dream of a peaceful future for Greece bleeds from him, staining the pristine stonework below."

Each day the political elite dwindle, some retiring due to factional pressures or personal morals, some too old and sick to carry on and those few model politicians remaining are subject to the whims of their Axis overlords or a lucky partisan’s bullet. \n\nAs the Parliament grows more decrepit its dusty halls have come alive with debate on how to deal with this. Though many seem content to simply wither away a few seem passionate enough to fight against this creeping stagnant rot, and factional lines are beginning to emerge around potential policies. \n\nThe Hellenic Fascist Front, aligning itself with the ideals of Mussolini and Petain, seek to modernise their politics. They aim to energise the younger generation with ideals of a modern and futurist fascism to inspire youth to take up arms not just in the army but in the civil service. Opposition sees this as horrifically out of touch with the reality of younger generations. \n\nMeanwhile the Hellenic National Socialist Faction suggests a sort of conscription to solve the issue. Eligible family members of current politicians will be granted immediate party membership and all the responsibilities that entails. This idea has received backlash for potentially breeding political dynasties, nepotism and a dispassionate political class. \n\nThough many within Parliament oppose both factional lines there seems little room for compromise. Whatever moderate groupings the late President Rallis had formed seem to have dissolved with his death. \n\nAs the debate peaks and the votes begin to tally a tie seems inevitable. However the fervour seems to, appropriately, be too much for one MP who collapsed due to a heart attack as the discussion becomes uproar.

While the balding fool of an ambassador "signed" away Kavala and Thrace back to us, their rightful owners, our boys continued to decimate the Bulgarian formations and take over village after village. And apparently, it seems, is that the ambassador's flight on its return has seemingly "vanished", some suspect foul play, but who cares about a missing fat ambassador when we have practically razed and burned half of Bulgaria. \n\nAircrafts coming back from reconnaissance sorties, observed and reported endless streams of Bulgarians fleeing from the ceded lands, eager to not be on official Greek land.

Though reports indicate it is increasingly difficult to organise any sort of evacuation in some of the more unfortunate areas, with the SB troops often randomly emptying submachine gun clips on streams of unarmed civilians heavily laden with luggage trying to get out of the ceded territories.

They were free to release their frustrations upon Bulgaria one last time. The most prominent victim among said territories was the city of Thessalonika.

All able bodied men were stripped from their families and aggressively thrown onto trucks headed to Greece-proper. We offered land to the Bulgarians, not able-bodied workers.

twrGreeceSBRaid.1.d:0 "Our latest set of 'ambassadors' to our neighbour have returned with tales of victory and more importantly, a good sum of loot. Their petty attempts at defence have been squashed by the strength of one of our Security Battalions, leaving our troops free to wreak unfiltered havoc on the various villages in the area. Some of the stories from the raiders were simply inspired! The Non-Hellen were purged as usual and the women who took our fancy were taken, along with anything else not bolted to the floor. \n\nA time will come to spread our borders and the Aryan Race of Hellas but tonight...tonight we celebrate!"
twrGreeceSBRaid.1.a:0 "Three cheers for Hellas!"
twrGreeceSBRaid.2.t:0 "Border Raid Failure"
twrGreeceSBRaid.2.d:0 "The most recent raid has returned and not with good news. Before the boys could get to what they do best, the border guard found them. The survivors have tried to defend their failure by claiming how glorious of a battle it was, making whatever pathetic lies they could to hide their weakness. They shame the Aryan race and Hellas with every word. Like the rest of the failures, they were executed as an example. When you serve the Aryan race as we do, weakness is not tolerated. The 'loot' from their corpses will serve to fund the next raid. \n\nWe may have been utterly embarrassed by their failure but next time...next time nothing will be spared. We'll take it all. Burn their homes, take their women and massacre anyone in our way! We will show our neighbours the true strength of Hellas!"

twrGreeceSBRaid.3.t:0 "Border Defense Victory"
twrGreeceSBRaid.3.d:0 "In recent days, we have received reports of the neighbouring Greeks crossing our borders, harassing and attempting to loot nearby settlements. This breach of sovereignty obviously could not stand. Nearby military divisions were dispatched to deal with these 'Security Battalion' brutes and we are proud to report that the thieving bandits have been repelled! \n\nAs relief forces arrived at the affected areas, the small villages that we could not reach in time were devastated. Civilians tell tales of executions of non-'Hellenics', the kidnapping of young women, some still missing and shear thuggish brutality. We must not allow such excursions into our borders happen again. We may have repelled them this time but we have no idea when the next attack may come. We must remain vigilant."
twrGreeceSBRaid.3.a:0 "Those 'Hellens' will never threaten our borders again!"
twrGreeceSBRaid.4.t:0 "Border Defense Failure"
twrGreeceSBRaid.4.d:0 "Disaster! Our neighbours, the Greeks, now calling themselves ‘Hellenic’ have crossed into our borders and ravaged the borderlands! Local military units were dispatched to disperse and rebel these bandits but somehow, these ‘Security Battalions’ have repelled our assault. With reinforcement too far away to be of any immediate help, local forces were forced to hide and simply witness the brutality these Battalions wrought upon our lands. \n\nThe reports returning to the government are...haunting. These Security Battalions, while acting as bandits in all but name, have brought a brutality to our lands that has left the nation in shock. We have had to classify many of the more disturbing ones but they have taken our women, gunned down the 'lesser people' in their eyes and stolen anything of worth. By the time more effective forces could come to expel them, they were gone, content with their assortment of loot, women and devastation. We must not let this happen again! Such barbarism cannot go unpunished!"
