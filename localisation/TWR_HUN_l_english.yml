croathungary.1.t:0 "Rebellion in Vojvodina"
croathungary.1.d:0 "Small rebellions flared up all over Vojvodina suddenly by Croats living in the area. Armed with pitchforks, axes and muskets from the previous century, Croats demanded Vojvodina be ceded to Croatia, to their "rightful homeland". While they were making such demands, they also destroyed major parts of the railway to the area, slowing down the movement of our troops to the region to suppress their rebellion. \n\nSomething isnt right about this suddent rebellion..."
croathungary.1.a:0 "Those Croats are up to something!"
croathungary.2.t:0 "The Croats Retreat!"
croathungary.2.d:0 "After defending our border in Vojvodina successfully, the Croatians have run off with their tails between their legs back to their country. Nobody messes with Hungary and wins!"

croathungary.3.t:0 "Loss of Vojvodina"
croathungary.3.d:0 "The damned Croats managed and defeated us in Vojvodina, making our troops retreat in the mainland. As the Croatian flag flies over Vojvodina, our flag is stepped on in shame by the Croatian soldiers."
croathungary.3.a:0 "We will be back Croats!"
croathungary.4.t:0 "Treaty of Pecs"
croathungary.4.d:0 "No matter what we did, the Croats defeated us in the war, forcing upon this embarassing treaty where we have to cede Vojvodina and Prekmurje to them. Upon us forcibly signing the treaty, the Croatian generals begun to insult us as they left the building. \n\nThis is a shameful moment for Hungary..."
croathungary.4.a:0 "We will be back Croats!"
croathungary.5.t:0 "Treaty of Zagreb"
croathungary.5.d:0 "Our valiant men brought honour to their homeland once more by beating down those despicable Croats in their own lands! With an unsteady and unwilling hand, the Croats signed the Treaty of Pecs, announcing their defeat and ceding to us Novi Sad. This is a victorious day for Hungary and another normal day for Croatia. \n\nCroats, a people stubborn enough to fight even when they have lost from the start!"
croathungary.5.a:0 "Dicsőség Magyarországnak!"

twrromaniahungary.10.t:0 "Horthy Resigns"
twrromaniahungary.10.d:0 "In a silent coup performed by members of the Hungarian Army, Hungary's Grand Admiral - Miklós Horthy has been pressured into resigning, officially stepping down after ruling as regent for decades.\n\nField Marshal Géza Lakatos has stepped in as Hungary's new 'Temporary Regent', declaring that Miklós Horthy is now incapable of any public office positions.\n\nReports of riots flooded Budapest, and our military is put on high alert to prevent any internal strife."
twrromaniahungary.10.a:0 "Thus, ending the Horthy era..."
twrromaniahungary.101.t:0 "Miklós Horthy Resigns"
twrromaniahungary.101.d:0 "After the shameful defeat against Romanians, Miklós Horthy's rule as regent has been under constant attack. Finally, after a silent coup by the military, Miklós Horthy was pressured into resigning, and transferring leadership to Field Marshal Géza Lakatos, ending the decades old Horthy dictatorship.\n\nWith the change of leadership, the title of 'Regent' has been replaced with the phrase 'Temporary Regent'. The new Hungarian administration did not press any charges on it's former dictator, and has made a public promise to ensure the Horthy family's safety."
twrromaniahungary.101.a:0 "Bye, Horthy."
twrromaniahungary.11.t:0 "Establishment of Carpatho-Ukraine"
twrromaniahungary.11.d:0 "Amidst the chaos, officials in Carpathia have taken this chance of political instability to establish their own illegal nation - Carpatho-Ukraine.\n\nUnder the conditions of the peace deal with Romania, we are not allowed to move against Carpathia, and Hungary is now technically forced to allow Carpatho-Ukraine to exist."
twrromaniahungary.11.a:0 "An illegal nation..."
twrromaniahungary.11.b:0 "Carpatho-Ukraine forever!"
twrromaniahungary.12.t:0 "Liberating Southern Slovakia"
twrromaniahungary.12.d:0 "Southern Slovakia calls for our liberation. With a weakened Hungary, it's our time to liberate our oppressed people and free them from Hungarian tyranny.\n\nWhile this might result in a future reaction from Hungary, this is the best and perhaps only chance for Slovakia to retake this piece of lost land."
twrromaniahungary.12.a:0 "Occupy Southern Slovakia!"
twrromaniahungary.12.b:0 "Do not provoke the Hungarians..."
twrromaniahungary.121.t:0 "Slovakians Occupy the Strip"
twrromaniahungary.121.d:0 "Slovakia has benefited from our downfall. When our country is swallowed by political instability, the Slovakian Government has forcefully occupied the strip region that was handed to us after the Hungarian-Slovak War.\n\nOur forces are needed to prevent a potential civil conflict occuring within our country, hence we were unable to respond to the Slovakian provokation."
twrromaniahungary.121.a:0 "We will remember this!"
twrromaniahungary.13.t:0 "Future of Hungary"
twrromaniahungary.13.d:0 "With Horthy gone, the future of Hungary is uncertain. There are multiple options which the military government can take to transform Hungary from an old Kingdom without a King, to potentially a more appropriate nation. \n\nHanding power to the ruling party of the Parliament, Egységes Párt (MÉP) is most suitable for a transition from Military Government to a Republic. Some even suggest that perhaps a true, unbiased public election should take place to fully transform Hungary into a Democratic Republic, with elections oversaw by the parliament."
twrromaniahungary.13.a:0 "Power to the MÉP!"
twrromaniahungary.13.b:0 "Power to the Prime Minister, then an election."
twrromaniahungary.13.c:0 "Military dictatorship isn't that bad..."
twrromaniahungary.103.t:0 "End of the Hungarian Kingdom"
twrromaniahungary.103.d:0 "Since the 1920s, Hungary was a Kingdom without a King, with a Grand Admiral in a landlocked country as it's Regent. However, this nation of irony has finally transformed, with the declaration of a brand new, independent, Second Hungarian Republic as it's replacement.\n\nThe Second Hungarian Republic was declared under Prime Minister László Bárdossy of the Egységes Párt, with rumours of an approaching election. The Hungarian government has yet to confirm or deny such rumours, and some argue that even with an election, the validity of such elections might be dubious at best, considering that the chance of a rigged election is likely."
twrromaniahungary.103.a:0 "A new Republic."
twrromaniahungary.131.t:0 "Arrows Cross Coup"
twrromaniahungary.131.d:0 "Using the chance of a transition from Kingdom to Republic, the Arrow Cross Party has been secretly organizing a coup with Hungarian nationalists. Leader of the Arrow Cross, Ferenc Szálasi has approached high-ranking generals to gain support for his coup. While most of the military is apolitical, Ferenc Szálasi's rhetoric seems to be welcoming for the hateful military command, promising an increase of resources and retaking of Hungary's lost lands."
twrromaniahungary.131.a:0 "Preserve the Republic!"
twrromaniahungary.131.b:0 "Let them in."
twrromaniahungary.104.t:0 "Fascist Coup in Hungary"
twrromaniahungary.104.d:0 "Briefly after the formation of the Second Republic, a group of fascists led by Ferenc Szálasi, with the aid of Hungarian Army, successfully overthrew the government. Ferenc Szálasi has disbanded the parliament, and made a fiery speech on the radio, promising to retake Hungary's lost glory under Horthy.\n\nThe Second Republic is no more, and it ended as soon as it began. The potential of yet another war in that region has again, increased significantly."
twrromaniahungary.104.a:0 "That was fast."
twrromaniahungary.14.t:0 "Hungarian Election"
twrromaniahungary.14.d:0 "After a period of preparations, a free and fair election shall determine the first Post-Horthy Prime Minister of the Hungarian Republic. While there are many parties taking part in this election, the main contenders are the Conservative FKgP, the Social Democratic MSZDP, and the ruling MÉP. These three parties have formed their own respective loose coalition, in order to increase their chances of winning the Hungarian electoral race."
twrromaniahungary.14.a:0 "Victory for the MÉP!"
twrromaniahungary.14.b:0 "Victory for the FKgP!"
twrromaniahungary.14.c:0 "Victory for the MSZDP!"

slovakia.70124.t:0 "The Slovakian Ceasefire"
slovakia.70124.d:0 "Despite the fact that we can clearly win a prolonged war with Slovakia, the populace has called for an end of this slow invasion of Slovakia. It is clear that Slovakia is not Hungary's greatest threat, with nations like Romania being a much dangerous problem than a pesky free Slovakia.\n\nSo, it is in Hungarian interest to settle for a peace with Slovakia, for now."
slovakia.70124.a:0 "Not a failure, just a tactical withdrawal!"

slovakia.701241.t:0 "Slovakia Crushed"
slovakia.701241.d:0 "For days, Slovakia took pride in being the first democratic nation in Central Europe since over a decade ago. However, as expected, this small nation was unable to stand against it's much stronger enemy in the South. Hungary has assumed full control over Slovakia as an attempt to "restore public order" in Slovakia, despite the well-known fact that the Hungarians have no intention of letting Slovakia return as an independent entity.\n\nThe Slovak Republic is no more, and the future for Slovakia seems to be one filled with Magyarization and a pawn between a future Hungarian-German dispute."
slovakia.701241.a:0 "Greater Hungary shall rise!"
slovakia.701241.b:0 "Who cares about Slovakia?"

slovakia.701231.t:0 "A Slovakian Miracle"
slovakia.701231.d:0 "Unexpected by all, the recently revolted Slovakian Republic has managed to accomplish the impossible by defending themselves from a much stronger enemy. Spirit runs high in Slovakia after this heroic victory, while the Hungarian leadership is eagered to erase this memory from the Hungarian consciousness.\n\nThis has cemented Slovakia's status as an independent Republic for now, though things will certainly change once Germany has gathered it's resources into one united entity. Nonetheless, Slovakia can now enjoy the brief taste of freedom after decades of subjugation."
slovakia.701231.a:0 "Slovakia is god's chosen nation!"
slovakia.701231.b:0 "Unexpected."

slovakia.70123.t:0 "Slovakian Victory"
slovakia.70123.d:0 "With our determination and willpower for a free and independent Slovakia, our brave soldiers were able to drive the Magyars away from Slovakia's borders! Wth multiple issues on their plate, the Hungarians have no choice but to sue for peace. Slovak nationhood has been preserved, and it's time for us to build a new, free Republic in the heart of Europe!"
slovakia.70123.a:0 "Rejoice!"
