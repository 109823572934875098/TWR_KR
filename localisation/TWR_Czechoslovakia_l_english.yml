slovakia.1.t:0 "Protests at Slovak University"
slovakia.1.d:0 "The collapse of German authority has raised doubts about the legitimacy and strength of the Tiso Regime. A crowd gathered on the grounds of Slovak University, demanding the Slovakian Government sever it's ties with former Axis nations and uphold Slovakian nationhood. Leaflets and speeches brought more and more people to the University, and the numbers of protestors grew drastically. The guards sent by Slovak Government reported that they are outnumbered and will not be able to control the situation, with some even being reported to have joined the protestors."
slovakia.1.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"
slovakia.2.t:0 "The Bratislava March"
slovakia.2.d:0 "The chanting crowds, disappointed at the lack of official responds for their demands, decided to march towards government buildings in Bratislava. During the marches, bystanders joined, the call for reform turned into chants for the removal of Tiso. The police that were sent to control the crowds had no choice but to retreat, however the protestors were finally stopped at the gates of the Government Office. They were greeted by a line of soldiers and sandbags, armed with rifles and standing tall against the protestors."
slovakia.2.a:0 "End this pesky protest!"
slovakia.3.t:0 "Bratislava Coup d'etat"
slovakia.3.d:0 "Shockingly, when the soldiers were commanded to open fire, they refused the order and defected to the protestors' side, opening the gates of the Government Building to the protestors. Later on, the Slovak Armed Forces have declared their open defiance against the Tiso Regime, proclaiming their loyalty to the Slovakian people. With Germany unable to reinforce him, Tiso received advice from Germany that he should seek support from Horthy's regime in Hungary to crush the disloyal military forces and end the revolt, while the military offered Tiso safety if he promises to surrender his power to the new regime."
slovakia.3.a:0 "Seek Hungarian support!"
slovakia.3.b:0 "Tiso agrees to resign."
slovakia.4.t:0 "Hungarian Control"
slovakia.4.d:0 "Hungary accepted Tiso's request and has directed a division of Hungarian soldiers to Slovakia. While the Hungarians effectively crushed the rebellious Slovakians and kept Tiso's regime in power, in reality, Slovakia has surrendered its rights to Hungary, becoming a facto puppet state. Was this the right price to pay for stability?"
slovakia.4.a:0 "Well, as long as I am in charge..."
slovakia.5.t:0 "Hungarians Refuse"
slovakia.5.d:0 "The request made by Tiso has been ignored by Hungary, and the Slovakian military has successfully captured Tiso and his cabinet. While the military ensured their safety, they were forced to resign and surrender to the new Republic."
slovakia.5.a:0 "Down with the Republic! Long live the Republic!"
slovakia.6.t:0 "Hungarian Invasion"
slovakia.6.d:0 "The Hungarians, threatened by the thought of a public revolution so close to its borders, have announced the newly created Republican Government illegal and used the excuse of "Restoring the Rightful Slovak Government" to launch a full scale invasion into Slovak lands. While most believe that this war is a lost cause for Slovakia, citizens from all ages are volunteering to defend the small nation. The young cabinet hopes to hold off the Hungarian offensive for long enough to gain a chance for peace negotiations."
slovakia.6.a:0 "Slovaks! Unite!"
slovakia.7.t:0 "The Vodca's Disgrace"
slovakia.7.d:0 "Jozef Tiso, autocrat and founder of the Slovakian nation, has been forced out of power not with a fight nor a revolution but with a sigh and perhaps a sense of silent gratitude. His senality and ineffectual rule has lead to Slovakia's German ‘advisors' growing dissatisfied with the current national leadership, after all how is the Germanic sphere meant to present a strong united front if one of its first members is lead by an old fool! At the behest of orders from Germania itself Stefan Tiso, the Vodca's own cousin, has come forth to the assembly of the Slovak republic with a wide range of accusations from attempted reformism to gross abuse of power. The vote to depose Jozef Tiso was near unanimous, German supervisors made sure of that. In the aftermath of such a vote Stefan Tiso, a devoted party man and proud pro-German loyalist, expected that he would be granted the position as the new vodca of Slovakia however it seems that other interests within the Slovakian government have been eyeing up the position. \n\nAlexander Mach, minister of the interior and de facto head of the Hlinka Guard, has been making preparations of his own to seize leadership. The influence of the Hlinka Guard has spread across our armed forces, their brutes gerrymander members of the government into siding with them and their ties with the SS has made Mach a favourable successor in the eyes of our German benefactors. \n\nIf Mach were to take control than it would spell an end for Stefan Tiso and his entire clique and the implementation of a new and terrifying ultranationalist agenda as well as the expansion of the Hlinka guard into all sectors of Slovakian society much in the same vein as the German SS, however if Stefan Tiso were to hold on and grab this rare opportunity of power than it would secure German support for his own faction and prevent yet another expansion of the Hlinka faction. \n\nUltimately the only way to legitimately secure power for both of the competing factions is to be appointed successor by the Slovakian assembly and the successor is…"
slovakia.7.a:0 "Alexander Mach, to a greater Slovakia!"
slovakia.7.b:0 "Stefan Tiso, long live the status quo!"
slovakia.8.t:0 "The Communist Offer"
slovakia.8.d:0 "Recently, representatives from all socialist and communist parties of Slovakia arrived at our front door with a proposal in hand. Having focused on our own national identity due to the war with Hungary, the United Slovakian Red Front have proposed the co-operation of our government with their united party in order to fight as one united people. \n\nOn one hand, having the communists on our side will result in a stronger Slovakian people, on the other hand we would have to conceed parts of our government to those Bolsheviks..."
slovakia.8.a:0 "We must unite the people no matter their ideas!"
slovakia.8.b:0 "We don't make deals with Bolsheviks!"
slovakia.100.t:0 "Slovakian Request"
slovakia.100.d:0 "The Tiso Regime in Slovakia has requested our support in crushing the rebellions in Slovakia, allowing us to enter Slovak land and construct bases, seemingly giving themselves up to Hungarian authority."
slovakia.100.a:0 "Send in the garrisons!"
slovakia.100.b:0 "Ignore them. We have bigger fish to fry."
slovakia.101.t:0 "Popular Revolt in Slovakia!"
slovakia.101.d:0 "News of Slovakia's revolution that ended in the removal of Tiso Regime has shocked many in Hungary. While some suggest that Hungary should pay closer attention to the issues of Romania, many advisors call for an invasion of Slovakia - they fear that the revolt in Slovakia might inspire another in Hungary, sparking a chain reaction that threatens the Horthy Government itself."
slovakia.101.a:0 "Raise our banners, invade Slovakia!"
slovakia.101.b:0 "The Romanian threat is greater than this."

Jozef_Tiso_DESC:0 "A politician and a Roman Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso headed the Slovak People's Party since 1938. After the collapse of Czechoslovakia, Jozef Tiso was offered the position as the president of a 'Free', 'Independent' Slovak Republic under German influence, an offer which Tiso welcomed with open arms.\n\nBeing a priest during his early days, Tiso fought against local poverty and alcoholism in Slovakia, in which his deeds have been overshadowed by the portfolio that he built as the President of Slovakia. According to the Czechoslovak National Army in Slovakia, Jozef Tiso is brutal in terms of suppressing any types of resistance, with a dark history of collaborating with Germany in deportations of Jews."
