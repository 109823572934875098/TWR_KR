 ##Leader Descs##
 BUL_Mihailov:0 "Ivan Mihailov‘s career reads like a travelogue of the Balkans: where the Bulgarian Nationalist Movement stayed in the confines of home territory, Mihailov’s best work has been elsewhere in the Balkans, furthering national interests by means which would generally be considered a form of state terror. His domestic popularity boosted by his foreign endeavours and Long career, Ivan now sits at the top of the Bulgarian nation. A terrorist he might have been, but it cannot be denied that his methods have been effective - and Mihailov is as capable of waging peace as he is at waging war. \n\nMihailov’s life is intertwined with the Organization he helped found, IMRO; the latter left a trail of murder and carnage across Macedonia and Serbia in the 1920s and 1930s, with the former working in the shadows to clean up the bloodwork. Kings, ministers, diplomats, and common people fell in the hundreds and thousands in the interests of the Bulgarian nation and the preservation of its people. Some of those casualties came from internal factions opposed to Mihailov’s presence. After IMRO ceased operations Ivan moved from Turkey to Macedonia and back again, eventually settling in the Ohrana militia and political movement. \n\nMihailov split from the Ohrana in 1945 (he remains friends with its leadership, including Kalchev), but his years in the movement have taught him a valuable lesson. Fascism is vital, but its divisiveness also makes it vulnerable - to survive, Mikhailov believes, the Bulgarian state must reform along pre-determined lines. Paramount to this reform is the security of the Balkans, and so the man known as the Ambassador Of Knives has unveiled a final plan for the region around him, to gather the Balkans in a tight embrace around Sofia as the core rebuilds itself. Resettlement, economic reorganisation, rebirth. No one can claim Mihailov is not ruthless, but no one can deny the size of his dreams."
 BUL_Kalchev:0 "Andon Kalchev has been accused of letting his acquaintances define his existence, a claim he fights at every turn: by far the most controversial acquaintance of his has been his collaboration with Italy and his increasingly dogged assertion that Italian fascism fits Bulgaria like a glove. Whether this assertion is true or false, it is undeniable that Kalchev is on very good terms with the neighbour across the Adriatic, and that his militias and government are increasingly defined by Italian advisors and training. Only a fool would ignore friends of the powerful - especially friends in powerful places themselves. And Andon now has the highest place in Bulgaria. \n\nA product of the diaspora of the Bulgarians across the Balkan states, the Bulgarian-by-blood returned to his homeland in the wake of Greek persecution. He quickly established himself as a leading military officer of considerable promise in the 1940s, leading military assistance ventures in collaboration with Italian and German forces in Greece and Bulgarization efforts in Bulgaria-occupied territories to be integrated into the new state. His mixed successes leading anti-Jewish cleanups in the Ohrana he helped found only led him to a position of greater reliance on the Italians for aid, advice and military backup, a connection that both parties have maintained over the postbellum years. \n\nKalchev plans for a great modernization, a state-led reform of local industry and a slow assimilation of periphery peoples into the State after the Italian model - but most ambitious of all is his plan to turn Bulgaria into a true Jewel of the Balkans through a massive increase in service-industry infrastructure. Most of the visitors he plans to attract will be Italian, which only adds to the suspicion of his critics, even so, Kalchev is determined that his plans will work, and that Italian friendship can only benefit Bulgaria. After all, it’s not like Italy will ever falter in its current strengths..."
 BUL_Alexander:0 "Even in the halls of the UBNF Alexander Belev is a controversial figure: they call him a collaborator-in-training, a German half-breed, even a double-agent in service to the Hitlerites. Belev has always shrugged these complaints off in public, but it is certainly uncanny how his enemies and his methods of disposing of said enemies invariably seem to coincide with those of the Germans. Nevertheless, Belev has managed to work his way to the highest office in Bulgaria, and radical plans have been unveiled to reform the blood and soil of Bulgaria. \n\nBelev, born to an Italian Dalmatian, was dogged by accusations of Jewish ancestry in his youth: his entire life has been an extended struggle against this accusation, and like most Fascists Belev is adept at defining himself in violent opposition to what he is not. In the Ministry of the Interior, Belev studied under Petra Grabowski, the pre-eminent Anti-Semite of the Bulgarian cabinet. In 1941 he began plans to introduce the Nuremberg Laws into Bulgaria, becoming a member of the SS in the process for his swift action in pushing it through the legislative chambers. He also leads the Ratniks, grown to a position of power and suspicion through their loyalty to the Orthodox Church and a hatred of Jews. \n\nBelev now believes that the Bulgarians are descended from Aryan intermarriage with the Southern Slavs, a marriage of Aryan racial superiority with the strength and solidarity of the Slavic people. He intends to preserve this ethnic blend through additional laws imposed on minorities, but by far his most innovative theories have concerned the Ukrainians, who are apparently descended from the same root stock as the Bulgarian people. If only language and tradition keeps a people apart, then the solution must be to destroy the barrier by the sword, to shape the two halves into a single whole by fire and fury - and Belev has no lack of either."

 BUL_Expand_Executive_Power_desc:0 "Many vultures are circling our beloved Bulgarian lands in these trying years, from the enemies abroad that are the talons of the German and Italian Eagle or the prospect of a reborn Russian bear, to the subversive elements at home that are attempting to subserve us to the decadence and weakness of the past. What Bulgaria needs in these trying times is a strong hand to save her from the horrors afar and most importantly herself..."

 BUL_Formalie_the_Greyshirts_desc:0 "The greyshirts served valiantly as the frontline in our first, feeble phase back when the idea of Fascism in Bulgaria was thought almost impossible, and the crushing anvil that ultimately smoldered our many enemies to bits once we emerged triumphant at last. Yet, like always a  special status breeds degeneracy and over the years it seems the greyshirts have lost their edge, become disorganized and privy to infighting. It is time to change that and forge them anew."
 BUL_Silence_the_Socialist_Opposition:0 "Silence the Socialist Opposition"
 BUL_Silence_the_Socialist_Opposition_desc:0 "The failure and utter defeat of Marx’s fever dream should be apparent to any that watched the brains of the German Spartacists being splattered under the boot of the brownshirts, the total defeat of Mao in the Chinese civil war or the fracture of the Soviet Union. However in our glorious state for some reason this foolhardy idea still persists, and even more curious our past attempts at rooting them out seems to have only bolstered their ranks. Now, at last this charade ends for good."

The incompetence of our secret service at this news is staggering and heads will definitely begin to roll there soon, yet despite that many of our high command have been scratching their head at the not just willingness, but explicit wish of the people to return to the weakness and decadence of old..."

 BUL_Go_with_Mihailov1:0 "Go with Mihailov"
 BUL_Go_with_Mihailov1_desc:0 "The Ambassador of Knives, Ivan Mihailov has proven himself a loyal and effective asset to The UBNL and Bulgaria as a whole, spreading and protecting its interests abroad, sabotaging its enemies. Now, after Lukov’s death, we have decided that it's up to him to lead Bulgaria into a new period of success and prosperity. His pragmatism and prowess will definitely help him in his task to further Bulgarian might and interest on the European Powder Keg. Some might question him, as he is a terrorist and quite renowned for his brutality, but this might just be what our country needs to withstand the tides."
 BUL_Kalchev_as_Minister1:0 "Kalchev as Minister"
 BUL_Kalchev_as_Minister1_desc:0 "Andon Kalchev, the chief of the Ohrana and an old friend of Mihailov can be a useful tool to exploit. He has proven himself competent on many occasions and his Italian ties cannot be ignored. He can make a valuable minister and can reassure the Ohrana’s loyalty and bring it closer to the government itself."
 BUL_Sideline_Kalchev1:0 "Sideline Kalchev"
 BUL_Sideline_Kalchev1_desc:0 "Andon Kalchev, although an old friend of Mihailov and a competent officer, is a lesser man. Throughout his life he’s been defined by his allies, by who he serves. Such a man cannot be useful to our plans and should be sent onto an irrelevant position in the party, where he will pose no danger or liability. Plus, removing him will open the doors for an integration of the Ohrana."
 BUL_Absorb_Kalchevists1:0 "Absorb Ohrana"
 BUL_Absorb_Kalchevists1_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with Kalchev, its time to divert out attention to the Ohrana. Our defense agency, our tool to pacify the reclaim lands, our weapon to assert Bulgarian supremacy over our enemies. Mihailov was for a long time part of it and understands its key importance. Therefore, the Ohrana shall hereby be absorbed into the Ministry Of Defense and The Government directly, to improve its credibility and ensure its loyalty."
 BUL_Exile_Belev1:0 "Exile Belev"
 BUL_Exile_Belev1_desc:0 "Alexander Belev, a Hitlerist, profound anti semite and the founder of The Ratniks. He grew in fame after overseeing the handing over of almost 12.000 jews. An unstable and dangerous man at the least. Mihailov has judged him too dangerous to his rule and therefore decided to exile him to Samothrace, where he can hardly pose a danger to anything except his own neighbors."
 BUL_Contain_the_Ratniks1:0 "Contain the Ratniks"
 BUL_Contain_the_Ratniks1_desc:0 "The Ratniks, an organization founded in 1936 by Belev. It’s a nazist organisation fighting for the minds of the youth, influencing them with nationalist and anti semitic propaganda. We believe however, it has outlived its purpose. After Belev’s exile, we see nothing in this ragtag SS that could possibly bring us, except a civil war because of their leader’s dismissal."
 BUL_Silence_Dissidents1:0 "Silence Dissidents"
 BUL_Silence_Dissidents1_desc:0 "Now that Mihailov has dealt with his most prominent contenders, it’s time to handle the more minor ones. All kinds of people, from monarchists, to liberals and communists, they must all be dealt with as well. Anybody who vocally disagrees with our regime and denounces it will meet an untimely demise, caused by unfortunate accidents. "
 BUL_Discredit_Lukov1:0 "Discredit Lukov"
 BUL_Discredit_Lukov1_desc:0 "On a regular UBNL party gathering this Monday, all of the major party members and journalists from selected presses will be present. It’s Mihailov’s opportunity to raise a rather interesting subject, that of Hristo Lukov, now late Chairman of the party and Prime Minister from 1941-1953. Mihailov will hold a speech in front of his colleagues and the press, denouncing Lukov and his policies and actions as foolish, against the interests of Bulgaria and judge him a German puppet and beginning a period of reform it The UBNL, for the greater good of the Rodina."
 BUL_Shrink_Down_the_Greyshirts1:0 "Shrink Down the Greyshirts"
 BUL_Shrink_Down_the_Greyshirts1_desc:0 "The Greyshirts, the famous paramilitary organisation of Lukov and his loyal soldiers. Now that he is dead, we must seek to shrink them down in size and install loyal assets in it, making sure that they, like the Ratniks, know their place and follow orders, in the name of Bulgaria’s prosperity and greater good."
 BUL_Time_for_Politics1:0 "Time for Politics"
 BUL_Time_for_Politics1_desc:0 "Now that Mihailov has took care of his contenders, consolidated the possible disloyal organisation, purged the opposition and has denounced Lukov, it's time to truly begin our political actions and maneuvers. It will not be easy, given the turmoil Europe is in currently, but we must carry on the legacy of Bulgaria and withstand the tides of malice that are coming our way!"
 
 ##Kalchev##
 BUL_Kalchev_Assumes_Control:0 "Kalchev Assumes Control"
 BUL_Kalchev_Assumes_Control_desc:0 "Andon Kalchev, the chief of the Ohrana and well known Italophile has assumed control, following Lukov’s death. The nation is now under his control and he’s free to shape it in his vision- It being one of industrialisation, modernisation, italian fascism and strong army. He has for most of his life been in the shadow of his peers and now his skills are put to the test."
 BUL_Italian_Fascism_in_Bulgaria:0 "Italian Fascism for Bulgaria"
 BUL_Italian_Fascism_in_Bulgaria_desc:0 "Now that Kalchev has secured power, his first and foremost step would be to implement Italian Fascism in Bulgaria, reforming the political system and expanding on Corporatist beliefs and policies even more. After that is gone, he will move to enlarge the Ohrana and give it more power, mirroring the Italian Blackshirts. The transition to a truly fascist state has started!"
 BUL_Expand_the_Kiril_Act1:0 "Expand the Kiril Act"
 BUL_Expand_the_Kiril_Act1_desc:0 "The Kiril Act, essentially a copy of The Acerbo Law,  states that the party gaining the largest share of the votes – provided they had gained at least 25 percent of the votes – gained two thirds of the seats in parliament. The remaining third was shared amongst the other parties proportionally. However with the lack of any strong opposition parties and organisations, convinced Kalchev to expand the law, so the the UBNL gains not only two thirds, but all the seats in parliament, clearing the way for its total dominance."
 BUL_Centralize_the_Greyshirts1:0 "Centralize the Greyshirts"
 BUL_Centralize_the_Greyshirts1_desc:0 "The greyshirts, our own equivalent of The Blackshirts, loyal and able, strong and mighty. Unfortunately, after Lukov’s death they’ve become a band of disorganised, indoctrinated militiamen. For them to be useful, Kalchev has chosen to centralise the command over it, picking loyal officers and assets of his and placing them on the top of the organisation, strengthening and reorganising the movement into an actual force."
 BUL_Introduce_Corporatism1:0 "Introduce Corporatism"
 BUL_Introduce_Corporatism1_desc:0 "Corporatism, the arguably most defining feature of fascism, has to be introduced in Bulgaria for the nation to advance and prosper in a fascist Europe. \n\nCorporatism is the belief of making the owner and workers of a factory to jointly control it, making sure no abuse or conflict erupts, furthermore the representation in parliament of not parties or beliefs, but of different branches and professions. This philosophy is essential to fascism and it has to be integrated into our society."
 BUL_Crush_Dissidents1:0 "Crush Dissidents"
 BUL_Crush_Dissidents1_desc:0 "And of course, in every fascist nation, there is resistance. Foolish leftists and hopeful democrats, all wanting to overthrow our prospering government! They shall not succeed! We will assemble the Ohrana, march forth the Greyshirts and punish the dissidents, show them who holds the power and how to obey it!"
 BUL_Cement_Fascism1:0 "Cement Fascism"
 BUL_Cement_Fascism1_desc:0 "With all the reforms and laws introduced by Andon Kalchev, we believe that fascism has been successfully cemented in Bulgarian society and that its influence will surely affect us for good. There is no going back now, the bundle of sticks stands tall and victorious over Sofia, the Greyshirts march with will and power, and the people look onto them with hope!"
 BUL_Begin_Centralisation_of_the_UBNF1:0 "Begin Centralisation of the UBNF"
 BUL_Begin_Centralisation_of_the_UBNF1_desc:0 "The UBNF is currently a loose coalition of several entities, one being the Ohrana, another The Ratniks and lastly The UBNL. For it to function effectively and efficiently, we need to centralise, reorganise and consolidate the UBNF, bringing it under the control of the Ohrana."
 BUL_Mihailov_as_Minister1:0 "Mihailov as Minister"
 BUL_Mihailov_as_Minister1_desc:0 "The Ambassador of Knives himself, Joan Mihailov, well known ruthlessly effective individual, will be the perfect asset for a minister. We believe that his traits can be well utilised in our affairs of state. He will receive his appointment and be assigned to work immediately."
 BUL_Placate_the_UBNL1:0 "Placate the UBNL"
 BUL_Placate_the_UBNL1_desc:0 "The UBNL, by far maybe the strongest party within the UBNF, it stands tall and strong. We will, however, have to consolidate it. To pacify and reassure the party, we will present false promises, some threats and in general make sure they follow us. This way we can proceed with our plan undisturbed and secure the UBNL at the same time."
 BUL_Dissolve_the_Ratniks1:0 "Dissolve the Ratniks"
 BUL_Dissolve_the_Ratniks1_desc:0 "The Ratniks, Mihailov’s organisation of radical anti semites and orthodox zealots, a rather dangerous and unstable band of individuals, is one of the 3 entities making up the UBNL. They however, have no place in it. Leader Andon Kalchev sees them unfit and too unstable, therefore their organisation shall be dissolved and they themselves assigned to insignificant positions within the party and Ohrana."
 BUL_Ohrana_Hegemony1:0 "Ohrana Hegemony"
 BUL_Ohrana_Hegemony1_desc:0 "We have taken care of all the other assets within the UBNL, leaving them either small, irrelevant, or completely dissolved. Our plan has been achieved and the UBNL is now under the control of the Ohrana and its allies. Bulgarian politics have been forever reformed and remade!"
 BUL_The_Party_is_United1:0 "The Party is United"
 BUL_The_Party_is_United1_desc:0 "The Party has, at last, been united under Kalchev and the Ohrana, the nation’s security and defense organisation. We have consolidated and secured our grip over Bulgarian politics and now have full control over them. What Kalchev says, it’s law. What the Ohrana does, it’s law. Long Live The Party!"
 BUL_The_Bulgarian_Il_Duce:0 "The Bulgarian Il Duce"
 BUL_The_Bulgarian_Il_Duce_desc:0 "Similarly to his Italian counterpart, Kalchev has assumed control over Bulgarian politics with swift maneuvers, consolidating his power, making allies and taking out any threats to his power. Some people have began calling him the \"Bulgarian Il Duce\", as an homage to Benito Mussolini. Kalchev, being who he is, gladly accepts this title and wears it with pride and might. Now that he is at the very top of Bulgaria, he is free to do anything he wishes. Slava na Kalchev, na Lidera!"

 ##Events \n\n
 twrbulgaria.1.t:0 "The Riots Begin"
 twrbulgaria.1.d:0 "The Vrana Palace has been described as a triumph of Baroque architecture, and is still studied by architecture students in Sofia as a model for applied aesthetic in estate design - despite the decidedly frosty attitude of the Bulgarian people towards their Regent, their affections for the royal estate are as strong as ever. Being the royal family’s permanent residence, access is restricted to high-level officials and official delegations to the Bulgarian state. Not that there are many of either group nowadays: it is said that Regent Kyril is as bad a toastmaster as he is an administrator. \n\nThe crowd marching to the Palace has no intention of playing at niceties over tea, however; waving banners and insignias of the royal crest, they call for the resignation of the Regent and his replacement with the Tsar as the legitimate controller and head of state. Kyril is quite clearly incompetent, and at this point any new leadership would be better than the devil they all know too well. Pitchforks, farming implements, and torches, it’s a scene out of the 19th century, if one ignores the occasional pistol or semi-automatic held aloft like a ceremonial sword. These people intend to bring Bulgaria back to sense, even if they must bloody their hands to do so. \n\nIt will not be their hands which are stained today, however the UBNF are waiting for them, and in a stroke of luck the Monarchists have arrived just in time to paper over the obvious divides between the various UBNF-aligned militias. Immediately the UBNF attempt to form a cordon, on the orders of their leaders this quickly falls apart as the first Monarchists reach their lines of defense and are quite literally dragged under by waves of angry fascist sympathisers. The few police troops standing guard watch helplessly as mobs of men fling themselves at each other. Fist by fist, tooth by tooth, bloodstream by bloodstream, Bulgaria is saved, or perhaps it is pulled deeper into the fire. From a distance, the two look almost identical."

Perhaps a nation only truly stops moving when its people do, when the roads are blocked and the trains grind to a halt for lack of fuel or passage. Perhaps it is when the apparatuses of state stop pumping paperwork into the vast circulatory net of bureaucracy that surrounds the regime. Or perhaps a nation only truly stops when something traumatizes the national consciousness into retreat, when the name of the country or its ruler becomes a matter of hushed silence and painful conversation, as if bearing witness to some intense and raw grief. \n\nThese paralyses have spread thick into the streets of Sofia, choking its smog-ridden winds like a haze that muffles the soul long before it clogs the lungs. The forces who still call themselves the UBNF (although there is little evidence that they are centrally organized, or indeed organized at all) grapple on the streets and in the dining-halls, tearing into loose detachments of monarchist-aligned militias with abandon. Districts switch allegiance twice a week as the roving mobs march in and are forced out by rivals, who are in turn forced out by other gangs. Guns echo hourly round the smoking capital, families hide in cellars or make plans to move in with relatives in the countryside. The police are undermanned, outgunned and overwhelmed. The army has melted away, or it, too, is paralyzed by fear. \n\nThere is a story making the rounds in what is left of the public sphere one night a father wakes up to find his wife kidnapped by the Monarchists. His son joins the Fascists and disappears into the sea of violence, his daughter attempts to flee with her boyfriend and is lost in the wave of refugees streaming out of Sofia, and the father, despairing of it all, is about to hang himself when the letter arrives. His wife is safe - but her family has evaporated. It might not be true, but it rings true, and what does truth matter when the world is falling apart?"

 twrbulgaria.3.d:0 "Sofia’s historical centre is a beautiful place at night. Most of the old architecture of the city and its famous cathedrals are concentrated in a stretch of the town where the centuries melt away and time itself seems to dissolve: the Alexander Nevsky stands above the beating heart of Sofia’s Orthodox centre, with Neo-Baroque and Neo-Classical architecture creating the illusion of concentric history unfolding on the skylines of posters. In the interbellum period a thriving business built on tourism had raised the eyes and attention of bureaucrats, but with the outbreak of war that faded, and the centre was closed to most civilians, barring the cathedrals. \n\nThey come first bearing the banners of lions and swastikas, bringing the customary bolt-action rifles and pistols and improvised bottles of liquid petroleum. Improvised barricades are set up across the parks and in the pews of the ancient domes. The Pantocrator stands high above in the dome, watching impassively as the walls and pews are stripped for firewood and building material. The few remaining priests beg the militias for reprieve, on God’s mercy if not their own, and are laughed off. \n\nOne night another mob bearing royal colors descends on the Centre, and the cheery tones of the day turn to gunfire and confusion. The attack is unexpected and the enemy is everywhere at once, men are cut down by their own in the fusillades. In the chaos one fuel-cocktail is thrown, and then another. Alexander Nevsky is built of wood and plaster. The fire spreads from the altar to the pews and then outside, to the park and its environs. Witnesses report scenes from the pages of the Inferno itself, as soldiers choke on fumes while shooting at enemies they can no longer see; at last, the dome itself collapses, a paint-weeping Christ falling from the heavens into the sea of flame. And a little more of Bulgaria is consumed with it."

Three days after the protests started he expired from malignant cancer of the lungs, watching his country’s heart choke on protests as his own filled with tumors. The few functionaries present did not record his private sorrows as he expired, but his death leaves the Legions with a problem: who will take care of the Ratniks? After a little squabbling in the UBNF, a candidate is declared: Alexander Belev, fellow antisemite and Legionnaire, will take over Grabovski’s responsibilities and announce the transition at the funeral. A potential gravesite is identified not too far from headquarters, and the Ratniks command structure plans a rough procession for the leader’s hearse, even as the fires rage unchecked. \n\n On the morning of the funeral, the procession, comprising of an improvised hearse-wagon and a series of ramshackle armored cars, begins its journey. What little spare manpower the Legions can spare is assembled, given unloaded Great War rifles and told to march down the street, a task which they accomplish with great enthusiasm (anything is better than fighting in the great slaughterhouse Sofia has become). All seems well. \n\nThen the improvised bombs go off. Monarchist saboteurs attack at different sites around the city, armed with pistols and handheld implements. The hearse itself goes up in flames as the procession is stormed with a squadron of militiamen, killing many, before they are themselves killed in a hail of gunfire. In an incident which rapidly makes it to the eyes of the national and global press, a desperate Fascist sergeant is photographed interrogating a Monarchist saboteur, pistol pointed at his temple, before pulling the trigger. This image above all else will define the funeral of Petar Grabovski. They will call it the Day of the Scarlet Rain, after the fine mist emanating from the head of the saboteur."

In the croak of sickly mothers, in the cry of swollen-bellied children, in the quiet sobbing of the cripples and beggars, in the buzz of flies around gutters choked with human waste and remains, Sofia is rotting away. The rot spreads, like any disease, around and through areas already burnt-out by sickness and hollowed out to nothingness: the suburbs, the teeming slums, the Centre, the industrial district. \n\nSoon there will be nothing left of Sofia to fight over. And what is Bulgaria if not Sofia? \n\nThe Army has vacillated between intervention in favor of a faction and simply sweeping the whole apparatus away, Fascists and Monarchists both. Generals assess civilian casualties with grim tones, and everywhere in the camps the Bulgarian Army breaks ranks to plead with superiors to do something, anything at all, about the breakdown. Refugees tell terrible tales and even more terrible silences meet those who dare to ask the bigger questions, what happens when those still alive in Sofia finally run out of food altogether, and where will the refugees go when the surrounding farmland is exhausted? \n\nAt night the burning city lights up the countryside with its endless flame. It issues gouts of billowed grey smoke, like an addict coughing out the opium-smoke from riddled lungs. Some say one can taste the blood if one sticks one’s tongue out far enough.

The Bulgarian people deserve to be ruled by their hearts and by the one who governs them, not by petty small-arms fire and violent suppression. That sort of treatment is reserved for Bulgaria’s enemies. It is a noble and principled stance, and very convenient in times of ideological suspicion. But the conditions that make this neutrality possible are coming to an end, as Sofia finishes burning to the ground - and the jackals who have burnt it down look around for fresh meat. \n\nBoth Fascist and Monarchist sympathisers have sent increasingly hysterical letters about the developing 'situation' in and around Sofia, begging the Army to intervene. These warnings went unheeded for the most part: once the Partisans were done squabbling, it was certain that a clear victor would emerge. Who would be responsible for safeguarding the sacred institutions of Bulgaria when that happened? The answer was transparently obvious. And so the Army stood ready and stayed their hand, waiting for the longed-for return to a functioning government (and guarding the borders against any opportunists). \n\nThis certainty has now vanished, as recent reports from refugees report widespread outbreaks disease, firing squads murdering entire neighbourhoods, and a general loss of civility. The situation is reaching unmanageable proportions, the death toll teeters on the brink of the tens of thousands. Sofia descended into violence a month ago, and it has now slipped into a state one could credibly describe as Anarchy. The General Staff holds a meeting at daybreak, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and fear. All agree on one thing, the time for waiting has passed. The time for action is now.

We’re running the gauntlet for breaking the rules of play (girls and boys aren’t supposed to hang out together after curfew), trying to move between two rows of friends, and our friends kick and punch with savage glee: but we have a plan. She pushes a girl out of the chain of flailing legs, I grab on to her arm and cling for dear life, and we slam onto the potholed streets of Sofia in a ball of tumbling excitement and clamber to our feet and I notice, for the first time, how bright her eyes shine when she smiles. \n\nI’m twelve, she’s fourteen. The bombed out city rushes at us as we dance through the streets, thick with reconstruction and the noise of life. Spices from the markets and the smell of petroleum fumes pool thick in the air as she leads me on, towards a garden they say the ears of the Legions and the Regency informants cannot reach. She dips her head towards me, half-whispers something to me in that lilt of hers, and the world stops around me - \n\nI’m sixteen, she’s eighteen, and we’re both out of time. The streets run thick with blood and the screams of men lost to the mobs, swastikas and heralds emblazoned on street-poles. Her father is a monarchist, mine a Legionnaire - we are torn screaming from each other, but only the old are foolish enough to think they can stop the hearts of the young.

Already the speeches are being written about Lukov’s brilliance and how his vision will guide the Bulgarian people into a new age (most of these speeches are being drafted by his ardent political rivals and those who wish to take the seat of power from his slowly stiffening corpse, of course, but posterity makes little distinction between genuine and manufactured sentimentality). \n\nAs the few surviving witnesses to the highly embarrassing circumstances of Lukov’s death are silenced by members of the Internal Security Branch of the Legions, preparations begin for an elaborate ceremony to legitimize the Bulgarian Fascist presence - the successor to Lukov and the leader of Bulgaria will step into his new post with aplomb. (Police posts across Sofia and the nation at large are under lockdown, the streets under curfew, and domestic intelligentsia are watched daily.) Funnily enough, the inner circle of the UBNF have not been seen together in public since the initial announcement, perhaps they are busy, or…? (The Legions’ Internal Security has readied makeshift graves outside major cities for anyone who dares to complete that sentence.) \n\nThe transition will be swift, it will be secure and it will be glorious. The cars arrive and the Inner Circle step out, one by one. (They don’t smile to each other.) The hearse is prayed over by the surviving priests of the Orthodox Church (at their insistence), and the coffin of Lukov is sanctified before being moved to his gravesite by mourning Inner Circle members (with carefully controlled sorrow on their faces).

The unfortunate circumstances of Lukov’s death were preserved by the state, and almost immediately barred from the general public, for posterity reasons - and also because the scene bore all the hallmarks of sabotage. Lukov died from an extremely quick-acting poison, orally ingested: the evidence points to arsenic. The question of who would dare poison such a prominent Fascist leader is almost too dangerous to answer. It is quite clear that almost everyone in the running for leadership had a clear motive for attempting such a thing, despite red-faced denials, not to mention the many segments of Bulgarian society who despise everything Lukov stood for. \n\nBehind the facade of unity presented by the Legion, the UBNF moves into feverish internal bickering. Faction leaders block the efforts of internal investigative authorities, are accused of murder and in turn attack the others for attempting to pin the blame on the innocent. A half-dozen Socialist and Communist groups take responsibility and are laughed off as ineffectual. All the personnel with him that night are exhaustively cross-examined, and in some cases shot as traitors or suspects. The investigation grinds to a halt just a few days after Lukov’s death, realising that whoever killed Lukov will remain shrouded in mystery for want of evidence or suspects. \n\nLukov dies, but there is still the problem of his position. And so the UBNF stops plotting over death, and begins plotting over what happens next."

As a special committee of the National Assembly, it essentially exists as an admission of emergency, which is why its members are so desperate to see it concluded. \n\nThere is no risk of competition from non-Fascist candidates, and the Assembly has itself been stacked with Fascists. Even so, there is a limit to the control a party can exact over its members, and plenty of politicking surrounds the upcoming election. Struggling to deal with the consequences of the previous disturbances in Sofia, several candidates have declared their intentions to regulate UBNF activity. In fact, some Assembly members declare the need to disarm the UBNF altogether. Others dismiss the idea as ridiculous, overreaching and ultimately suicidal to the Organization’s activity. \n\nChaos and calm, in alternating intervals, surrounds the candidates in their speeches and comments to the Assembly.

Well, business as usual is a strictly operative phrase: it would be more accurate to call it inaction as usual, especially since the regime’s recent moves have caused it to haemorrhage support. Factionalism tends to grow wild where leadership is left wanting - this is amply evident in the barely controlled chaos, as legislators struggle to get their voice heard in the clamor of the crowd. Many are angry these days, on the streets and in the halls of power, and outside the Assembly a crowd has gathered to protest despite the attendant dangers. \n\nMilitary Guards are always present in the Assembly, for security measures and as a nakedly veiled threat against legislators who might think to openly voice dissent against the regime. Their presence is never questioned, even when numbers begin to grow past expected limits: perhaps there is an internal security threat the Assembly is unaware of, it is reasoned, and perhaps the times Bulgaria is living through justify the means necessary to secure the safety of the people therein. And of course the Military must take a seat at the table of power, the gun is the source of all power, as the late Mao Tse-Tung said, so why restrain oneself from recognising the obvious? \n\nSo the coup creeps in unquestioned, a General at a time. When the curtains fall and the soldiers march in there is no one left to resist. At least it is quick, the arrest of the entire Assembly and their replacement, under duress, with a crew of senior military staff is choreographed and meticulous. The Constitution even looks the same as the old one, except in a few places where the line between civilian and military replacement procedures is suddenly absent. Nobody questions it, of course.

Increased investment in productive capital, young Bulgarians coming out of university, and the economic realignment of the new German Europe all coalesced into almost double digit GDP growth between 1946 and 1950. Unemployment was low, the government was running on a budget surplus for the first time since the war, and our top economic analysts had determined that this growth would carry us through at least 1955. Truly, it seemed as though Bulgaria was going to crave its place in the new world order. \n\nBy 1951, those hopes had almost been entirely dashed. The economy stopped growing at the high rates it enjoyed just five years earlier, and it seemed as though the country was due for a localized recession. The volatile political situation in the rest of Europe gave a lot of investors second thoughts, and as Bulgarians began to lose their jobs, more businesses started failing. Some sort of response was needed to prevent a total economic crash. \n\nBut that response never came, and this Monday, the Sofia Stock Exchange became silent in its horror.

Seemingly innocuous at first, an economist by trade but without his involvement the meat grinder would and could not have functioned the way it did. \n\nFinally Kiril Preslavski, regent, enabler, traitor. Whilst not directly involved in the regime of what Mussolini laid the blueprint for so long ago he allowed them to seize power, he was the one who allowed the fascists to usurp the government with the kings blessing.

The traitor who allowed Lukov to escape justice at last was searched for feverishly, yet none was found. Lukov's final curse onto Bulgarian land it seemed was his inability to accept his fate. \n\nUp next was the son and bureaucrat Mihailov, he was spared the rope but not the key. He would spend the next 20 years under the lock, maybe less of course. Plenty of time to try to polish his image, some joked. A sentence too lenient others groaned. \n\nThen the economist Kalchev, he met the same fate as Mikhailov. Maybe they would exchange letters in prison, they might even pass the time recounting long lost glory. Rumors persisted of them having already signed lucrative deals for first hand accounts of their time in the ministry. \n\nThen the butcher Belev, the rope he met. And face it he would. Only the execution did not go smoothly and he struggled for almost ten minutes before his neck finally snapped. A fitting end, no? The mastermind behind the nightmare escaped the clutches of justice, his bloody arm fortunately didn't. Perhaps for his last moments he didn't want to live up to his reputation. \n\nFinally the regent Preslavski, he opened the fascists the door to power and behind closed ones he would spent the rest of his days. This proved to cause quite the stir, after all what was a man only barely involved in the regime sentenced to more than those directly involved? The reasoning, the judges gave was the possibility of him corrupting the monarchic soul once more, yet that served only to fan the flames, for what were Mikhailov and Kalchev to do once they saw the light of day once more? \n\nWith the demons struck down, the land could breathe again.

He begun. \n\n'The late Vodach Lukov through his years of service has brought much grief and suffering to our nation, while I am not one to slight the dead, in this case I must renounce my convictions for the good of the nation. Lukov has betrayed the spirit of the very nation and crown after betraying its soul and spirit, raped its body, destroyed our people's livelihood, turned neighbor against neighbor and made them endure unspeakable hardship, all in the name of personal glory and pride! His first crime, sullying the nations spirit, by creating a personality cult around the monarchy he eroded the peoples very beliefs, made them lose faith in the bonds that hold this land and people together - all for his personally vainglory, as he wanted to bath in the light of glory that wasn't his - and never will be.

The people's will will finally be made reality!' \n\nAudible gasps in the assembly, some turned over to their neighbor but he ceaselessly finished the assault. \n\n'The late Vodach then, having spilled the blood of our countries men, did not see, hear or relent in the rape of our nation, instead he doubled down, his incompetence blooming as he grew ever more paranoid by the passing day. He refused valuable and brilliant advice by comrade Kalchev, a trend continued with the entire rest of the cabinet, ruling thenceforth as a tyrant not the helmsman he was supposed to be!' \n\nMihailov looked throughout the chamber thoroughly pleased, almost everyone was in some state of shock, anger or even sadness.

I have never seen such a sight in any of my travels, and I find it hard to believe that such beauty could exist in this earthly domain. The river that flows through it is so immaculate, that even from my vantage point, I can see into it. The vegetation is so lush that the garden of creation seems like a barren desert in comparison. \n\nBut this sightseeing never lasts long, as when I turn around, an army of ghostly figures appear before me. I am frozen in my place, until one of them steps forward, and pushes to me off the edge. I fall for what feels like an eternity, until I suddenly awake in a cold sweat."

I find that it helps me pass the time, and I have even decided to place some of the better ones around the room. Reminds me that I am still alive, and that I still have the power to create things. \n\nI was always used to being drawn or painted, but I was never really allowed to take up the craft myself. Father said that it was beneath my station, and that a man of my blood fulfills himself behind a cannon, not an easel, I must only have been about 7 or 8 years old at that time. I must’ve been hardly seven or eight years of age when he said that, but it has always stuck with me. Regardless of what he said, I always drew a little bit here and there. I imagine all of those sketches must be lost in drawers and notebooks that I have long since forgotten. \n\nI believe we all need to create things, or at least, have the ability to."

We talk about how each of us is feeling, what is going on in the outside world, and other more miscellaneous subjects. I sometimes get the impression that she does not really want to come visit me, perhaps mother has urged her to do so. I don’t really wish to ask her, it would probably only make her feel worse about the situation. \n\nShe stayed for about a half hour, and then left about as quietly as she came in. To be perfectly honest, I would rather not come at all if she’s only visiting unwillingly. It makes me feel like a tiresome chore, and that is the last thing I need at the moment. \n\nPerhaps I'll ask mother about this the next time she visits."

I feel like an empty vessel drifting through an even emptier void. At this point, I would prefer it if they conscripted me against my will, at least that would give me something to do! Why is this happening! Why am I being punished like this! \n\nMy entire life is a nightmare now, but it is one of the most benign constitutions imaginable. My captors are not harming me, they are not depriving me of food or drink, they let my family visit me, but I still feel like I’m suffocating. I’ve lost track of what day it is, and I barely remember what Bulgaria looks like outside of this godforsaken room. When will I be free again? \n\nWhen?"

I have also taken the liberty of naming her Matilda, as she had no name when the guards brought her in. She is a very playful and attentive dog, at times it almost feels as though I can carry a conversation with her. Matilda likes to be rubbed on her stomach, as well as on the underside of her chin, which is an attribute common to most dogs I suppose. She seems to be of a mildly advanced age, but I have no way of knowing how old she is exactly. \n\nIn all honesty, Matilda is one of the few things that has been keeping me sane in here. All of my friends have perished or gone into hiding. My family has all but forgotten about me, letting me rot in a chamber guarded by men who are not even armed, but Matilda is here. I cannot disappoint Matilda, because she asks nothing of me. Matilda cannot disappoint me, because the only thing I require from her is her continued existence, and she fulfills that requirement every day. There is no way I could thank her enough for this. I love this dog more than life itself."

Should they ever clash truly their battle would be legendary - or so the Bulgarian High command hopes. \n\nBut as always, state propaganda does not tell the whole story. Despite official mutual condemnations Bulgaria is economically quite dependant on German money. Readily accepting ample investments and access to the giants economic sphere. \n\nYet the true nature is perhaps even more sinister, the main exports of the Reich are not wares but working hands. Fleeing from the horrific treatment in the Reichskommissariat, dozens of Ukrainian refugees are fleeing into Bulgaria every week. Working for but any price in face of the hellscape that became their home, they proved an ample boost to Bulgaria's economy - at first. With the tide of flesh being without end their numbers have started to cause problems, pushing out Bulgarian’s out of blue collar jobs and crowding the slums in the cities, public ire is beginning to stir. \n\nWhich of course provides ample propaganda opportunities for the UBNF - propaganda that basically writes itself - the issue still remains however: another one on the list of ever faster ticking timebombs which Lukov and Preslavski will have to carefully defuse should they hope to retain the system they created, or their head on their necks."
